# FINAL PROJECT OF COMMAND LINE GIS SPINRG 2024 BY HYERYENG SHIN

## SYNOPSIS

**Scale and Location** All counties in New Jersey

**Topic** Good neighborhood to live

**Research Question** To identify the county offering the most favorable living conditions, I will selectively assess 10 key factors

**Mapping** I aim to apply suitability analysis techniques learned from my Topics in GIS class using command-line tools. For the static maps, I will generate choropleth maps, components for the suitability analysis, and eventually produce the final suitability analysis map. Furthermore, I intend to integrate this final map with an appropriate base map to create an interactive visualization
